    "In this section, you've learned a lot about importing, cleaning up, analyzing (using descriptive statistics) and visualizing data. In this cumulative lab, you'll get a chance to practice all of these skills with the Ames Housing dataset, which contains information about home sales in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010.\n",

    "* Practice loading data with pandas\n",
    "* Practice calculating measures of centrality and dispersion with pandas\n",
    "* Practice creating subsets of data with pandas\n",
    "* Practice using data visualizations to explore data, and interpreting those visualizations\n",
